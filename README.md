# BreakoutAdapter

For some use cases, I need to build BreakoutAdapters for setup and testing. I decided to publish this stuff here. Maybe you have similar use cases or need for some other stuff. The projects are independently and build with KiCad 7. If you don't know KiCad please refer to <https://www.kicad.org/>.

In addition to that, I published the boards at PCBWay Shared Projects.

## Header Breakout

The boards are follwing the same principle.
