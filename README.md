# BreakoutAdapter

For some use cases, I need to build BreakoutAdapters for setup and testing. I decided to publish this stuff here. Maybe you have similar use cases or need for some other stuff. The projects are independently and build with KiCad 7 (mostly, some are build with KiCad 8). If you don't know KiCad please refer to <https://www.kicad.org/>.

In addition to that, I published the boards at PCBWay Shared Projects.

## Header Breakout

The boards are follwing the same principle.

I did some changes on the board layout and the labeling.
